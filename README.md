# Advent of Code 2024

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

For every day, there is a project folder. Also, each day has a script in the scripts folder (I use the script to test and so on).

Happy holydays and good code :)
